= Embedding Containers

== Introduction

Fedora bootc ships with https://podman.io[podman] installed to run application containers.

This document describes a pattern for physically embedding containers inside the base
bootc container image.  At runtime, they have a distinct root filesystem, but
the client system only fetches and processes the base bootc image.

See xref:running-containers.adoc[Running containers] for
a model where the application workloads are instead "floating" and can
be updated and versioned distinct from the base bootc image.

== Example configuration 

TODO - this is being debated/tracked https://github.com/CentOS/centos-bootc/issues/282[in this issue] for now.
