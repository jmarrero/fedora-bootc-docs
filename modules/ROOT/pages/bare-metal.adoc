= Installing Fedora bootc on Bare Metal

This guide provides instructions to install Fedora bootc to bare metal. Three options are available:

* Installing from Anaconda
* Installing from the container

== Prerequisite

Before installing Fedora bootc, it's recommended that you have created a customized derived container image;
but this is not a hard requirement.

Fedora bootc can be installed using https://anaconda-installer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Anaconda].

== Installing from the network

The `ostreecontainer` kickstart verb can be used to provision your custom container image.
