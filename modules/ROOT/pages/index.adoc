= Fedora/CentOS bootc Documentation

The Fedora/CentOS bootc project generates reference "base images" that
are designed for use with the https://github.com/containers/bootc[bootc project].

Its goal is to provide a host system easily configurable via container
tooling, usable as a container host, but also to allow non-containerized
deployments with applications bound to the host context.

Fedora bootc is an open source project associated with the link:https://fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Project] and the link:https://www.centos.org[CentOS Project].
