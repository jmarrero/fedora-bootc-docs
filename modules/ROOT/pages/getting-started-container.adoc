You can run any of the containers via any OCI compliant runtime, such as `podman`, `docker` etc.
The images are configured to launch systemd by default, but in order to just inspect
the system you will likely want to invoke e.g. `bash`:

```
$ podman run --rm -ti quay.io/centos-bootc/centos-bootc:stream9 bash
bash-5.1# rpm -q kernel systemd podman bootc
kernel-5.14.0-432.el9.aarch64
systemd-252-32.el9.aarch64
podman-5.0.0-1.el9.aarch64
bootc-0.1.7-1.el9.aarch64
bash-5.1# 
```

If you invoke the container without `bash`, it is configured
to run `/sbin/init` by default, which is not configured
to auto-login on the console.  You would need to e.g.
```
$ podman exec -ti wizardly_kare bash
```

to get an interactive shell (replace `wizardly_kare` with the actual container name).
