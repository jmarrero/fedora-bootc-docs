= Getting Started with Fedora/CentOS bootc

== Introduction

The Fedora/CentOS bootc project generates reference "base images" that
are designed for use with the https://github.com/containers/bootc[bootc project].

=== Container Images

These are the two "full" container images:

- {container-c9s} (CentOS Stream 9)
- {container-fedora-full} (Fedora 40)

=== Provisioning Philosophy

It is generally expected that you create a *custom* container image, derived from one of our base images for deployment.

For more information on configuration, refer to the documentation for xref:building-containers.adoc[Building containers].

== Quickstart

=== Running as a container

include::getting-started-container.adoc[]

=== Booting on a local hypervisor

include::getting-started-local-virt.adoc[]

=== Booting on a cloud VM (AWS example)

include::getting-started-aws.adoc[]

=== Exploring the OS for the first time

By design, there are no hard-coded default credentials or non-root interactive users.

If you set up an xref:authentication.adoc[SSH key], you can SSH into the VM and explore the OS:

[source, bash]
----
ssh root@<ip address>
----
